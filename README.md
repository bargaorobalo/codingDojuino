=============

This project is a controller for Coding Dojos. 

What is this: A hardware to control when audience can speak whit pilot and co-pilot and control the time of dojo's turn. 

How it works: The pilot who's programming allows the audience to comment about the solution only if the green light on, when red light on, everybody muted.

Hardware list:
* Arduino
* pushbutton
* resistor 10k ohm
* 20 red LED | 20 green LED
* Depending of your LED, resistor supplies (parallel connection)
* wires
* pack of battery (9v ~ 12v)
* empty crisp fries package or some enclosure

Todos:
- use a switch button to start/stop the system
- define: time of rounds = 7min; action finished time = all lights blinking same time;
- create a better README, it looks like sketchbook
